# Machine Learning Oil

Training a regression model for choosing the best region to develop new oil wells.

This notebook performs a brief EDA in 3 datasets for 3 different regions. 

To work with 3 datasets, define functions for split and scaling, fit and predictions, calcular previsões médias e RMSE.

Calculates the profit of the best wells in each region. Performs bootsrapping to calculate the average profit, confidence interval and risk of loss.

- id* — unique oil well identifier

- f0, f1, f2* — three point characteristics (their specific meaning is not important, but the characteristics themselves are significant)

- product* — volume of reserves in the oil well (thousands of barrels).

The data is synthetic and does not include any contract details or well characteristics.
